# Hedge Vault — Architecture Evolution

How the program should grow from the mainnet v1
(`r2ahBQ6gbPCJ9FxBymYcXuwXi8NmenRry7SE7QR7FAt`) into a multi-manager, policy-controlled
fund platform without ever breaking deployed state. Each section follows the same shape:
**problem today → target design (diagram) → how it works → data changes → migration.**

## 1. First principles

The program is a custody and share-accounting kernel. Pricing, strategy selection and
reporting live off-chain and can be replaced at any time. That split decides what may
change freely and what may not.

**Must hold forever**

- PDA seeds and account discriminators. Clients, indexers and other programs derive them.
- Meaning and width of every existing field. Shares in circulation are valued through them.
- The share mint per vault. It is the depositor's claim; it cannot be swapped.
- Invariants:
  - `deposit_escrow.amount == vault.pending_deposits`
  - `share_escrow.amount == vault.pending_withdrawal_shares`
  - `nav_per_share` changes only inside `update_nav` / `override_nav`
  - a request resolves only at a NAV posted in a later epoch than its creation

**Will change most, so must be additive**

- Who may do what (roles, delegation, policy).
- Which protocols the vault can touch.
- How NAV is attested and how much the updater is trusted.

**Design rules that follow**

- Add capabilities as new PDAs keyed off existing ones, not as fields crammed into Vault.
- Every account carries a `version` so readers can branch.
- Reserve bytes before you need them; a realloc migration costs a release, padding costs nothing.

## 2. Evolution overview

### 2.1 Today

    Vault --> ShareMint[share mint]
    Vault --> Escrow[escrows]

    Requests --> Vault
```

Single keys everywhere, no limits on what a manager may do with funds, one updater, no
events for indexers, and a `Config` with 6 spare bytes.

### 2.2 Target

```mermaid

        Oracle[(Pyth)] -.->|floor check| Vault
        Crank((resolver crank)) --> Settlement
        Indexer --> Events[(events)]
    end
```

Every new box is a new PDA type or an off-chain service. Vault and the share mint are
unchanged in meaning; they only gain fields inside bytes already reserved.

### 2.3 Phases

```mermaid

    Phase 3 : settlement : EpochSettlement : pro-rata fills : batch resolve
    Phase 4 : expansion : Kamino, DAMM v2, perps : vault-of-vaults : Token-2022 shares
```

## 3. Account data evolution

### 3.1 Why layout is the hard constraint

Two serialization models are in use and they grow differently.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph zc [Zero-copy: Config, Vault]
        A[bytes are the struct, repr C] --> B{new field fits in padding?}
        B -- yes --> C[rename padding bytes, same size, no migration]
        B -- no --> D[realloc account, append fields, new bytes are zero]
    end
    subgraph borsh [Borsh: Manager, Strategy, Requests]
        E[bytes decoded field by field] --> F{data shorter than struct?}
        F -- yes --> G[deserialize fails, account unreadable]
        F -- no --> H[ok]
        G --> I[realloc + re-serialize, or drain and recreate]
    end
```

- **Zero-copy** accounts tolerate appended bytes because old offsets never move. A field
  added at the end with value `0` must therefore mean "legacy behaviour" (for example
  `epoch_duration == 0` → use the global constant).
- **Zero-copy alignment**: `repr(C)` plus `Pod` forbids implicit padding, so appended
  fields must be ordered widest first (Pubkey/i64, then u32, then u16, then u8) and end on an
  8-byte boundary.
- **Borsh** accounts break the moment the struct is longer than the data. Short-lived ones
  (requests) are simply drained; long-lived ones (Manager, Strategy) need an explicit
  migration or a version byte read before the rest of the struct.

### 3.2 Byte budgets today

| Account | Kind | Size | Free bytes | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Config | zero-copy | 160 | 6 | forever, singleton |
| Vault | zero-copy | 424 | 121 | years |
| Manager | borsh | 41 | 0 | until removed |
| Strategy | borsh | 97 | 6 (before enum) | until closed |
| DepositRequest / WithdrawalRequest | borsh | 89 | 0 | one or two epochs |

Config v1, byte offsets including the 8-byte discriminator:

```mermaid
packet-beta
title Config v1 - 160 bytes
0-7: "discriminator"
8-39: "admin"
40-71: "nav_updater"

152: "st"

```

Vault v1:

```mermaid

303: "p"
304-423: "padding1 - 120 bytes reserved"
```

### 3.3 Growth mechanics and the migration flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Release
    participant Crank as Admin or crank
    participant Prog as Program
    participant Acc as Account (v1 bytes)
    Dev->>Prog: deploy build that reads v1 and v2
    Crank->>Prog: migrate_<account>(payer)
    Prog->>Acc: realloc(new_size, zero_init = true)
    Prog->>Acc: write version = 2, set non-zero defaults
    Note over Prog,Acc: old offsets untouched, new bytes appended
    Crank->>Prog: any instruction
    Prog->>Acc: read version
    alt version < required
        Prog-->>Crank: error AccountNotMigrated
    else
        Prog-->>Crank: proceed
    end
    Dev->>Prog: two releases later, drop the v1 reader
```

Rules:

- **Append only.** Never reorder, never change a width. Consume padding first, realloc second.
- **Version byte everywhere.** Vault and Strategy have spare bytes for it today; Config gets
  it in the v2 realloc.
- **Realloc limits.** Max +10 240 bytes per instruction, payer funds the extra rent. Every
  account here is far below that.
- **Zero means legacy.** Any appended numeric field must treat `0` as "not set".
- **Drain rule for requests.** Pause → post NAV → resolve everything → upgrade → unpause.
  No migration code for accounts that live one epoch.
- **Never shrink.** Rent refunds are not worth a layout fork.

### 3.4 Config v2 target layout

Config has 6 spare bytes and is already initialized on mainnet, so a realloc is unavoidable.
It is cheapest before any vault exists, because nothing else references its bytes yet.

Shipped in Phase 0 as version + reserve only. Later phases carve named fields out of the
reserve in place (zero-copy, no further realloc), widest first to keep `Pod` alignment.

```mermaid
packet-beta
title Config v2 - 352 bytes (v1 bytes unchanged, version + reserve appended)
0-159: "Config v1 exactly as deployed"
160: "v"
161-167: "pad"
168-351: "reserve - 184 bytes, carved by later phases"
```

Planned carve-up of the reserve, in order of appearance:

| Future field | Bytes | Phase | Purpose | Zero means |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pending_admin` | 32 | 1 | two-step admin transfer | no transfer pending |
| `pending_change_ts` | 8 | 1 | timelock anchor | none pending |
| `default_epoch_duration` | 8 | 1 | base for per-vault epochs | use 86 400 |
| `timelock_secs` | 4 | 1 | delay on sensitive config changes | immediate |
| `resolution_delay_secs` | 4 | 2 | wait after a NAV post before resolution | no delay |
| `min_nav_updaters` | 1 | 2 | attestation quorum | single updater |
| remaining | 127 | — | phases 3–4 | — |

Migration: `migrate_config`, admin-signed, checks the account is exactly the 160-byte v1
layout and the signer is its admin, tops up rent, resizes to 352, sets `version = 2`.
One transaction, done once.

### 3.5 Vault budget plan

Vault has 121 free bytes. The plan below spends 77 and keeps 44. It fits only because of one
rule: **no Pubkeys inside Vault.** Every link is a PDA derived from the vault key
(`["policy", vault]`, `["operator", vault, key]`, `["settlement", vault, epoch]`), so a
32-byte pointer costs zero bytes.

```mermaid
packet-beta
title Vault v2 - same 424 bytes, padding carved (bytes 303-423)
0-302: "Vault v1 fields exactly as deployed"
303: "v"
304-311: "epoch_duration"
312-319: "min_deposit"
320-327: "min_withdrawal_shares"
328-335: "last_override_ts"
336-343: "total_deposited"
344-351: "total_withdrawn"
352-359: "fee_effective_ts"
360-367: "epoch_inflow"
368-369: "nav dev"
370-371: "outflow"
372-373: "pend perf"
374-375: "pend mgmt"
376-379: "nav_update_count"
380-423: "reserved - 44 bytes"
```

| Field | Phase | Enforced / used in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | 0 | every instruction |
| `epoch_duration` | 1 | `Vault::epoch`, replaces the global constant when non-zero |
| `max_nav_deviation_bps`, `max_epoch_outflow_bps` (per-vault override) | 1 | `update_nav`, `resolve_withdrawal_request` |
| `min_deposit`, `min_withdrawal_shares` | 1 | `request_*`, dust protection |
| `pending_*_fee_bps`, `fee_effective_ts` | 1 | `update_vault` schedules, `update_nav` applies after timelock |
| `last_override_ts`, `nav_update_count` | 2 | override audit, rate limit |
| `total_deposited`, `total_withdrawn` | 3 | lifetime stats for UI and fee analytics |
| `epoch_inflow` | 3 | deposit cap per epoch |

No realloc is needed for Vault through Phase 3.

### 3.6 Manager, Strategy, Requests

**Manager (41 bytes, 0 free).** Keep it as a pure whitelist marker. Limits go into a
`ManagerPolicy` PDA `["manager_policy", authority]` (max vaults, max aggregate deposit cap,
expiry, allowed protocols). The marker never migrates; policy can be recreated freely.

**Strategy (97 bytes, 6 free before the enum).**

```mermaid
packet-beta
title Strategy v1 - 97 bytes
0-7: "discriminator"
8-39: "vault"
40-47: "created_ts"
48-55: "last_action_ts"
56: "id"
57: "b"
58: "v"
59: "st"
60-63: "pad"
64: "enum tag"
65-96: "payload: target_mint or position"
```

- `version` and `status` (active / winding down / closed) take 2 of the 6 padding bytes now.
- Cumulative `deployed` / `withdrawn` counters (record keeping, not accounting) need a
  realloc. Bundle it with the first new protocol variant so managers migrate once.
- New protocols are new enum variants. `StrategyType::space()` sizes each account at
  creation, so a bigger payload only affects new strategies.

**Requests (89 bytes, 0 free, live one or two epochs).** Use the drain rule for the next
layout change and add `padding: [u8; 16]` at that point so later changes need no drain.
Candidate fields: `sequence` for FIFO, `min_shares_out` / `min_amount_out` for user-side NAV
slippage, `filled` for pro-rata settlement.

## 4. Roles and access control

### 4.1 Problem today

Four protocol roles and every manager are single hot keys. A manager's bot must hold the
manager key to trade. The program upgrade authority is one key.

### 4.2 Target authority graph

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph protocol [Protocol roles]
        MS((admin multisig)) -->|"after timelock_secs"| Config
        MS -->|rotate| U1((updater 1)) & U2((updater 2)) & U3((updater 3))
        MS -->|rotate| G1((guardian bot)) & G2((guardian human))
        MS -->|rotate| T((treasury authority))
        MS -->|upgrade after timelock| Program
    end
    subgraph vault [Per-vault roles]
        M((manager key, cold)) -->|creates| Op1[Operator: rebalance bot]
        M -->|creates| Op2[Operator: fee claimer]
        Op1 -->|EXECUTE_DLMM, EXIT_DLMM, EXECUTE_JUPITER| Strategy
        Op2 -->|CLAIM_FEES| Vault
        M -->|update_vault, close_vault| Vault
    end
```

### 4.3 Role matrix

| Action | Today | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| change config, fees, bounds | admin key, immediate | multisig, `timelock_secs` delay, two-step admin transfer |
| pause | guardian key | any guardian in the set, plus an automated pause bot |
| unpause | admin | admin multisig |
| post NAV | one updater key | N-of-M attestations (Section 6) |
| override NAV | admin | admin multisig, audited, rate limited |
| create vault | whitelisted manager | manager within `ManagerPolicy` |
| execute / exit strategy | vault authority | vault authority or Operator with matching bit, within `VaultPolicy` |
| claim manager fee | vault authority | vault authority or Operator `CLAIM_FEES` |
| resolve requests | anyone | anyone, ordered by settlement (Section 7) |
| upgrade program | single key | multisig + timelock + verified build hash |

### 4.4 Operator delegation, how it works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Manager (cold key)
    participant P as Program
    participant B as Bot (operator key)
    M->>P: create_operator(vault, bot_key, permissions = EXECUTE_DLMM | EXIT_DLMM)
    P->>P: init Operator PDA ["operator", vault, bot_key]
    B->>P: execute_strategy_meteora_dlmm(authority = bot_key, operator = PDA)
    P->>P: authority == vault.authority ? ok : operator.permissions has EXECUTE_DLMM ? ok : error
    P->>P: VaultPolicy checks (Section 5)
    P->>DLMM: CPI signed by vault PDA
    M->>P: revoke_operator(vault, bot_key) closes the PDA
```

- `Operator` layout: `vault: Pubkey`, `authority: Pubkey`, `permissions: u64`,
  `expires_at: i64`, `bump: u8`, 32 bytes reserve. Created and closed by the vault authority.
- Permission bits: `INIT_STRATEGY`, `CLOSE_STRATEGY`, `EXECUTE_JUPITER`, `EXIT_JUPITER`,
  `EXECUTE_DLMM`, `EXIT_DLMM`, `CLAIM_FEES`, `UPDATE_VAULT_DESCRIPTION`. Bits 8–63 reserved.
- Accounting code does not change; only the authority check at the top of each strategy
  handler gains one branch.

### 4.5 Multisig and timelock

- Admin key → Squads multisig. No program change needed; `config.admin` is just a pubkey.
- Timelock inside the program (`timelock_secs`): sensitive `update_config` fields are
  written as `pending_*` with `pending_change_ts`, applied by a second call after the delay.
  Guardians can pause during the window. Non-sensitive fields (description) stay immediate.
- Upgrade authority → the same multisig behind a timelock program, plus a verified build so
  the on-chain hash is reproducible from the repo.

---

## 5. Policy and action control

### 5.1 Problem today

A manager can swap the vault's deposit mint into any token, open a DLMM position in any pool
of any width, and deploy 100 % of assets into one strategy. Depositors rely entirely on the
manager's judgement.

### 5.2 Target enforcement path

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Ix[strategy instruction] --> Auth{authority or Operator bit?}
    Auth -- no --> E1[error]
    Auth -- yes --> Proto{protocol bit in VaultPolicy.allowed_protocols?}
    Proto -- no --> E2[error]
    Proto -- yes --> Mint{mints in VaultPolicy.allowed_mints or allowlist marker exists?}
    Mint -- no --> E3[error]
    Mint -- yes --> Size{amount <= total_assets x max_strategy_allocation_bps?}
    Size -- no --> E4[error]
    Size -- yes --> Slip{slippage <= max_slippage_bps?}
    Slip -- no --> E5[error]
    Slip -- yes --> Cool{now - strategy.last_action_ts >= cooldown?}
    Cool -- no --> E6[error]
    Cool -- yes --> Idle{idle balance after action >= pending withdrawals + min_idle_bps?}
    Idle -- no --> E7[error]
    Idle -- yes --> CPI[protocol CPI]
```

### 5.3 VaultPolicy account

PDA `["policy", vault]`, zero-copy, fixed size so it never needs ad hoc migration. Created
by the admin with protocol-level floors; the manager may only tighten values.

| Field | Type | Checked in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allowed_protocols` | `u64` bitmask (bit per StrategyType variant) | `initialize_strategy_*` |
| `allowed_mints` | `[Pubkey; 8]` | Jupiter execute destination, DLMM init pair mints |
| `max_strategy_allocation_bps` | `u16` | execute: `amount <= total_assets * bps / 10_000` |
| `max_slippage_bps` | `u16` | Jupiter `slippage_bps`, DLMM `max_active_bin_slippage` |
| `max_strategies` | `u8` | `initialize_strategy_*` against `vault.next_strategy_id` |
| `action_cooldown_secs` | `u32` | execute/exit via `strategy.last_action_ts` |
| `min_idle_bps` | `u16` | execute: keep idle funds for pending withdrawals |
| `manager_can_tighten` | `u8` bool | `update_policy` |
| reserve | 64 bytes | |

`total_assets` used in the allocation check is the last posted NAV figure, at most one epoch
stale. That is acceptable for a cap; it is not accounting.

### 5.4 Unbounded allowlists

Eight mints per policy is enough for most vaults, but pools and markets are unbounded. Use
marker PDAs exactly like Manager:

- `["allowlist", kind, key]` where `kind` is `mint`, `dlmm_pool`, `kamino_reserve`, …
- Admin creates and closes them. Instructions require the marker account to exist.
- Zero data, ~0.001 SOL rent each, no size limit, no migration ever.

---

## 6. NAV pipeline

### 6.1 Today

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as updater key
    participant P as Program
    participant V as Vault
    U->>P: update_nav(total_assets)
    P->>P: total_assets >= idle balance
    P->>P: epoch > vault.nav_epoch
    P->>P: |nav - prev| <= max_nav_deviation_bps
    P->>V: fees as dilution, nav, hwm, epoch_outflow = 0
    Note over V: requests from earlier epochs become resolvable immediately
```

Single key, single sanity floor, no correction window.

### 6.2 Target

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U1 as updater 1
    participant U2 as updater 2
    participant O as Pyth (remaining accounts)
    participant P as Program
    participant V as Vault
    participant G as guardian
    U1->>P: attest_nav(total_assets)
    P->>P: store NavAttestation ["attestation", vault, epoch, U1]
    U2->>P: attest_nav(total_assets')
    P->>P: |total_assets' - total_assets| within tolerance, count >= min_nav_updaters
    P->>O: read balances x prices for oracle-priced holdings
    P->>P: total_assets >= idle + oracle_value x (1 - tolerance)
    P->>P: deviation bound, per-vault or config default
    P->>V: finalize nav, nav_ts = now, nav_update_count++
    Note over V: requests resolvable after nav_ts + resolution_delay_secs
    G-->>P: pause_protocol within the delay window if the post looks wrong
```

### 6.3 Components

- **Per-vault epoch.** `epoch = (now - vault_epoch_offset) / vault.epoch_duration` when set,
  else the global constant. High-volatility vaults can run 4–8 h epochs.
- **Attestation quorum.** `NavAttestation` PDAs are cheap (vault, epoch, updater, value,
  ts). The last attestation that completes the quorum finalizes; others are closed for rent.
  A stolen key can no longer post alone.
- **Oracle floor.** Extends the idle-balance floor to deployed funds for assets with a
  Pyth feed. It bounds under-reporting; over-reporting is still bounded by the deviation cap
  and outflow cap.
- **Resolution delay.** The only change to request logic: `is_resolvable` also requires
  `now >= vault.last_nav_ts + resolution_delay_secs`.
- **Override audit.** `override_nav` writes `last_override_ts`, emits a reason hash, and
  policy can cap overrides to one per N epochs.

### 6.4 Epoch lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Open : epoch starts
    Open --> Open : requests accumulate
    Open --> Attesting : first attest_nav
    Attesting --> Attesting : more attestations
    Attesting --> Posted : quorum + checks pass
    Posted --> Settling : resolution_delay elapsed
    Settling --> Settling : resolve / batch resolve within outflow cap
    Settling --> [*] : next epoch starts
    Posted --> Paused : guardian pause
    Paused --> Posted : admin unpause or override_nav
```

---

## 7. Request settlement

### 7.1 Problem today

The outflow cap turns resolution into a race. Whoever cranks first is paid; later requests
wait a full epoch even if they were older.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    NAV[NAV posted, cap = 20 percent] --> R1[request A, 15 percent] --> OK1[paid]
    NAV --> R2[request B, 10 percent] --> Fail[EpochOutflowCapReached, waits an epoch]
    R1 -. cranked first .-> OK1
```

### 7.2 Target: EpochSettlement with pro-rata fills

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as updater
    participant P as Program
    participant S as EpochSettlement ["settlement", vault, epoch]
    participant C as crank
    U->>P: update_nav
    P->>S: create: nav, total_withdrawal_shares = vault.pending_withdrawal_shares, payable = total_assets x outflow_bps
    C->>P: resolve_withdrawal_request(A)
    P->>P: fill_A = min(A.shares, A.shares x payable / (total_shares x nav))
    P->>S: filled += fill_A
    P->>P: burn fill_A, pay out, A.shares -= fill_A
    alt A.shares == 0
        P->>P: close request
    else
        P->>P: A.epoch = current epoch, rolls to next settlement
    end
```

- Fills are proportional and order-independent, so the crank order no longer matters.
- Unfilled shares stay escrowed and roll forward automatically; no user action needed.
- Deposits do not need settlement objects; they are never capped.
- `batch_resolve` takes N requests as remaining accounts for the crank.
- Optional strict FIFO instead of pro-rata: add `sequence` to requests and require
  `sequence == settlement.next_sequence`.
- Per-user request key becomes `["deposit_request", vault, user, nonce]` if merging by epoch
  proves too restrictive.

        I[initialize_strategy_X: record + open position owned by vault PDA]
        E[execute_strategy_X: vault ATAs -> protocol, policy checked]
        X[exit_strategy_X: protocol -> vault ATAs]

    IDL[declare_program! idls/x.json] --> E & X
```

- Keep the MirrorFi shape. Each protocol is one enum variant, three instructions, one IDL,
  and one arm in `close_strategy`.
- Adapter checklist: position owned by the vault PDA; only vault ATAs move tokens; no CPI can
  alter who signs for the vault; every account the protocol writes is passed explicitly.
- Compute and size: DLMM already needs ~1.4M CU headroom and bin-array remaining accounts.
  Ship an address lookup table per protocol with the handlers.
- Vault-of-vaults needs no program change: a parent vault's deposit mint is a child vault's
  share mint, and its NAV is `child_nav × shares`, computed off-chain like any other asset.
- Token-2022 share mints (transfer hooks for allowlisted holders) are a per-vault option:
  `initialize_vault` picks the token program; everything else already uses `token_interface`.

## 9. Observability and off-chain services

The program emits no events today. Indexers and the updater would have to diff account
snapshots, which does not scale past a handful of vaults.

```mermaid

    Prog[program] -->|emit!| Ev[(events: ConfigUpdated, VaultCreated, NavPosted, NavOverridden, RequestCreated, RequestCancelled, RequestResolved, StrategyExecuted, StrategyExited, FeesAccrued, FeesClaimed)]
    Ev --> Idx[indexer / DB]
    Idx --> API[app API]
    Idx --> Upd[NAV updater: positions per vault]
    Upd -->|attest_nav| Prog
    Ev --> Crank[resolver crank: runs after each NavPosted]
    Crank -->|resolve / batch_resolve| Prog
    Ev --> Watch[pause bot: deviation, outflow, missed epochs]
    Watch -->|pause_protocol| Prog
```

- Events are additive and free to add in Phase 0.
- Service inventory: NAV updater (per vault, per epoch, N keys), resolver crank, pause bot,
  indexer. Each is stateless against the chain because events carry every transition.

## 10. Operational security

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    Deployer((deployer key, today)) -.->|migrate to| MS((admin multisig))
    MS --> TL[timelock program] --> UA[upgrade authority]
    UA --> Prog[program]
    Repo[repo tag] -->|solana-verify| Hash[on-chain build hash]
    Hash --- Prog
    MS --> Config
    Config --> Roles[admin, updaters, guardians, treasury on distinct keys]
```

- Today all four config authorities are the same wallet, set as placeholders. Split them
  before the first external deposit.
- Incident runbook: guardian pauses → admin rotates the compromised key via `update_config`
  → `override_nav` if a bad NAV landed → review settlements → unpause.
- Publish `security.txt` and the IDL on-chain so integrators and auditors resolve the
  program without the repo.

## 11. Roadmap

| Phase | Deliverables | Account deltas | Migration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — before first vault | **implemented:** `migrate_config`, `version` in Config/Vault/Strategy, events on every transition. **operational:** admin + upgrade authority to multisig, split the four placeholder keys | Config 160 → 352 | `anchor upgrade`, then `anchor run migrate-config` |
| 1 — policy | `VaultPolicy`, `Operator`, `ManagerPolicy`, allowlist markers; per-vault epoch, bounds, min sizes, timelocked fees | Vault uses 41 padding bytes; 4 new PDA types | none, zero means legacy |
| 2 — NAV hardening | `attest_nav` quorum, `resolution_delay_secs`, oracle floor, override audit | Config v2 fields; `NavAttestation` PDA; Vault uses 12 bytes | none |
| 3 — settlement | `EpochSettlement`, pro-rata fills, `batch_resolve`, request padding | Requests +16 bytes; Vault uses 24 bytes; 1 new PDA | drain window for requests |
| 4 — expansion | Kamino, DAMM v2, perps variants; strategy counters; vault-of-vaults; Token-2022 shares | Strategy realloc | crank per strategy |

**Phase 0 is time-sensitive.** `next_vault_id` is 0 on mainnet: migrating Config and
adding version bytes now means no vault, request or strategy ever exists on a layout
without a version. Everything after that is additive.
